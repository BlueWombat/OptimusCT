Using this package is rather simple.

For each project you install this package to, we add a file in the root of your project called "OptimusCT.config", and it contains the environments you want to register for transforming.

By environment we refer to the part of the filename immediately before the .config extension, ie. "App.Development.config" with "Development" being the environment in this case.

I'm sure you'll figure it out, happy transforming :-)
